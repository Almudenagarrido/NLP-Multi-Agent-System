    "### Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "This system implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture designed to analyze financial news in real-time and provide intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries. The pipeline integrates multiple specialized agents that work collaboratively to retrieve, analyze, and synthesize financial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **News Retrieval Agent**: Fetches real-time financial news from multiple sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis Agent**: Performs sentiment scoring on news content\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Topic Classification Agent**: Routes queries to appropriate domain specialists\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialist Agents**: Domain-specific models fine-tuned for financial topics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation & Optimization**: Continuous improvement through feedback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory System**: Maintains conversation history and context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Stack**: Python, HuggingFace Transformers, PyTorch, Custom Fine-tuned Models"
