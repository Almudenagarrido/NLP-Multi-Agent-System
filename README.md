# NLP-Multi-Agent-System - Group 5

This project explores the implementation of a **multi-agent system for Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks.  
It has been developed as part of a **university group project (Group 5)**.

The system is composed of several agents that collaborate to process and analyze text data.  
Each agent is responsible for a specific task within the NLP pipeline ‚Äî such as **data preprocessing**, **information retrieval**, **model inference**, or **evaluation** ‚Äî enabling modularity and cooperative problem solving.

## üöÄ Local Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

 git clone https://github.com/Almudenagarrido/NLP-Multi-Agent-System
 cd NLP-Multi-Agent-System

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

 python3 -m venv venv  # macOS/Linux
 source venv/bin/activate

 python -m venv venv   # Windows
 venv\Scripts\activate

### 3. Install dependencies

 pip install -r requirements.txt

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

### üìÅ Create .env document

The project requires some configuration values to be stored in a .env file found in the directory of the project. This file stores environment variables such as API keys or other configuration settings needed for the project.

Start by copying the provided example file and filling in the required values:

 cp .env.example .env   # macOS/Linux
 copy .env.example .env # Windows

### üîë NewsAPI Key

The NewsRetrievalAgent uses NewsAPI to fetch financial and business news.

To enable this functionality:

1. Go to https://newsapi.org/register

2. Create a free account

3. You will receive an API key

4. Copy this key and paste it into your .env file:

 NEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

 This key allows the agent to access the NewsAPI endpoint and fetch financial news.

## üß™ Testing Access to Data Source

### üîπYahoo finance API
To test data access and prepare a small sample dataset from **Yahoo Finance**, run the provided script located in the tests/ directory:

 python tests/test_yahoo_access.py

### üîπNewsAPI

To verify that your **NewsAPI** key is correctly set up and that the agent can fetch news articles, run:

 python tests/test_newsapi_access.py

Both these scripts will automatically create a small sample dataset and save it locally in:

 tests/data/

## üì∞ News Retrieval Agent

The **NewsRetrievalAgent** collects recent financial news for predefined tickers from **Yahoo Finance** and **NewsAPI**.  
It merges and cleans the results, allowing export to **JSON**, **DataFrame**, or **CSV** formats.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Ticker Discovery

Automatically converts company names to stock symbols using real-time financial data from Yahoo Finance.

### ‚ö° Quick Test

To test its functionality, open:

 src/agents/news_retrieval_agent.py

Set the variable:

 RUN_TEST = True

and run:

 python src/agents/news_retrieval_agent.py

This will retrieve sample news (e.g., AAPL, TSLA), print a summary in the terminal, and optionally save the data in data/raw/, as long as your .env file is correctly configured.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Sentiment Analysis Agent

The *SentimentAnalysisAgent* analyzes financial news content and classifies sentiment as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It uses specialized models trained on financial texts for accurate market sentiment detection.

### ‚ö° Quick Test

To test its functionality, open:

 src/agents/sentiment_analysis_agent.py

Set the variable:

 RUN_TEST = True

and run:

 python src/agents/sentiment_analysis_agent.py

This will analyze sample financial news headlines, print sentiment tags with confidence scores in the terminal, and show the probability distribution for each classification.

## üìä Evaluator Optimizer Agent

The EvaluatorOptimizerAgent provides intelligent quality assessment using semantic similarity analysis. It evaluates specialist responses across multiple dimensions by measuring how well the response aligns with the original query, news context, and historical conversations.

### üéØ Evaluation Criteria

Using **Sentence Transformers**, the evaluator measures:

- **Relevance**: Semantic similarity between response and original query

- **Accuracy**: Alignment with factual information from news summaries

- **Completeness**: Response length and content diversity

- **Context Usage**: Incorporation of news and historical Q&A data

- **Clarity**: Internal coherence and logical flow of the response

### üìà Multi-Dimensional Scoring

Each dimension receives a score 0-100, with an overall weighted average:

- Relevance to user query (20%)

- Factual accuracy from news (20%)

- Context utilization (20%)

- Response completeness (20%)

- Clarity and structure (20%)

### ‚ö° Quick Test

To test its functionality, open:

 src/agents/evaluator_optimizer_agent.py

Set the variable:

 RUN_TEST = True

and run:

 python src/agents/evaluator_optimizer_agent.py

This will run a sample evaluations showing This will run sample evaluations showing an overall quality score (0-100), detailed dimension scores, the specific critical issues identified, strengths found in the response and actionable improvement suggestions.

## üß† Train the Specialized Agents

From the project‚Äôs main folder, run:

 python src/agents/specialized_agents_training.py

This will create topic-specific generator models inside:

 src/agents/specialized_agents/

The current base model being fine-tuned is:

 google/flan-t5-large

## üß© Running the Full Pipeline

Once the agents have been trained and the environment is configured, you can execute the full system flow.
